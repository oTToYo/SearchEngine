texe mining course assignment1

Use the given dataset (hw1dataset30k, about 30k Chinese+English documents) and implement a simple search engine (programming language and system interface are not limited). Try the following queries and retrieve top-20 results for each query. Please also evaluate your results.
(1)  (coming soon...) (2)  (3)  (4) (5) (a meaningful digit that can be found in dataset) (6) (any interesting query you find)

Note: You should implement at least 2 different ranking approaches.

You should write a report for your system, including:
* system architecture, flow, techniques you use (e.g., stemming, TF-IDF)
* for each query, draw the graph of top-k precision vs. k
* Performance discussion
* Discussion (what you learned from this project and your comments about this project)

Please also upload your source code together! 

Due: 10/21 9am (before WIR class)
